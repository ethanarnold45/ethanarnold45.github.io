    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
    <p>I am a third-year mathematics student at Durham Univeristy. My main interest is pure mathematics, specifically topology and analysis. However, I also hold a deep affection for theoretical physics!</p>
    <p>I am currently averaging 85%, placing me top 10 in my cohort.</p>
    <p>I aspire to go into professional academia. I hope to complete a PhD and go on to conduct research in mathematics.</p>

        <h3>A Relatively Stand-Alone Proof <br> of The Whitney-Graustein Theorem</h3>
        <p>In 1937, Hassler Whitney, with the help of William Graustein, proved two regular closed curves are regular homotopic if and only if they have the same rotation number. Their proof is remarkably beautiful, however, it is dated and is not keeping with modern terminology and definitions in differential topology. Whitney's proof also largely refers to other sources, and he sometimes relies on intuitive steps which he does not rigourously prove. </p>
        <p>In this short paper, which will eventually form part of my bachelor's dissertation, I have updated Whitney's proof to match modern language, consolidated his relevent citations, and added more rigour to his original proof.</p>

        <p>In advance of this project I was awarded the London Mathematical Society's highly competitive Undergraduate Summer Research Bursary. I worked under the close supervision of a renowned Professor in the Durham mathematics department and learnt valuable research skills whilst advancing my mathematical knowledge.  </p>
        <p>This project was an incredibly enjoyable experience and only reinforced my aspirations of becoming a research mathematician.</p>
