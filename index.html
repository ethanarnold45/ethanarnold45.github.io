        <p>I am a third-year mathematics student at Durham Univeristy. My main interest is pure mathematics, specifically topology and analysis. However, I also hold a deep affection for theoretical physics!</p>
        <p>I am currently averaging 85%, placing me top 10 in my cohort.</p>
        <p>I aspire to go into professional academia. I hope to complete a PhD and go on to conduct research in mathematics.</p>

                <h3>A Relatively Stand-Alone Proof <br> of The Whitney-Graustein Theorem</h3>
                <p>In 1937, Hassler Whitney, with the help of William Graustein, proved two regular closed curves are regular homotopic if and only if they have the same rotation number. Their proof is remarkably beautiful, however, it is dated and is not keeping with modern terminology and definitions in differential topology. Whitney's proof also largely refers to other sources, and he sometimes relies on intuitive steps which he does not rigourously prove. </p>
                <p>In this short paper, which will eventually form part of my bachelor's dissertation, I have updated Whitney's proof to match modern language, consolidated his relevent citations, and added more rigour to his original proof.</p>

                <h3>Anomalies in Quantum Field Theory</h3>
                <p>This is a collaborative paper I co-authored with a friend and fellow Durham student, Kofi Okeyre.</p>
                <p>In this paper, we detail the effect of continuous symmetries on classical gauge
                    theories namely, Noether’s theorems, before gauging the Dirac Lagrangian’s axial symmetry
                    to obtain a QED analogue of the interaction between massless Dirac
                    fermions and U(1) axial bosons; an ‘axial theory’. Subsequently, we investigate the effect
                    of a classical theory’s symmetries on the quantum field theory (QFT) via Slavnov-Taylor
                    and Ward-Takahashi identities, and we find that, for the class of symmetries with infinitesimal generators linear in the dynamical fields, a singular path integral Jacobian matrix
                    characterises the presence of an anomaly in the quantised theory. Moreover, anomalies can
                    be seen as topological invariants of a QFT, and gauging an anomalous ‘linear’ symmetry
                    results in a violation of unitarity; an inconsistent quantum theory. In the case of the ‘axial
                    theory’, we compute the anomaly explicitly.</p>

                <h3>Investigating the Intrinsic Geometry <br> of the CelebA Dataset Using Diffusion Geometry</h3>
                <p>In this project I used novel diffusion geometry techniques to investigate the curvature and dimension of a large facial attributes dataset. Before discussing my results, I begin by explaining the relevant mathematical background neccessary to understand the results of these tools. This includes discussing 2-manifolds and diffusion maps.</p>
                <p>In advance of this project I was awarded the London Mathematical Society's highly competitive Undergraduate Summer Research Bursary. I worked under the close supervision of a renowned Professor in the Durham mathematics department and learnt valuable research skills whilst advancing my mathematical knowledge.  </p>
                <p>This project was an incredibly enjoyable experience and only reinforced my aspirations of becoming a research mathematician.</p>
